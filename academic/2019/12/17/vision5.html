<p>This project is a continuation of the SLIC Superpixel segmentation project I <a href="/academic/2019/11/07/vision3.html">worked on earlier</a>. SLIC is an inherently iterative algorithm which finds which pixels belong to which cluster centroids, moves the centroids, and checks again iteratively until convergence. This is a fairly memory intensive process due to the nature of every iteration has to keep track of every centroids relation to every pixel in range. It can be optimized for runtime by employing parallel calculations but the memory usage remains high regardless. <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ivrl/research/snic-superpixels/">SNIC</a> improves upon this process in 2 main ways. It reduces memory usage by only checking nearby pixels at a given time instead of all in range, and eliminates the need for multiple iterations by online-updating the centroid locations as the algorithm runs. In order to do this, it uses a priority queue to keep tracking of the nearest-distance pixel to add to the cluster next. The only downside is due to this being mostly sequential, it cannot be parallelized as easily as SLIC. However if your main concern is memory usage or you do not have parallel computing capability on your platform, SNIC is a good alternative to SLIC.</p>

<p>This project was mostly about comparing the performance and trade-offs of SLIC vs SNIC, so below are the comparisons I did:</p>

<p>I chose to compare a few different implementations for a fair comparison, considering optimized and non-optimized versions of SLIC.</p>

<p><b>JM-SLIC</b> My original SLIC from project 3. A purely sequential implementation of simplified SLIC. Non-optimized.<br />
<b>ZM-SLIC</b> A provided vectorized implementation of simplified SLIC from project 3.<br />
<b>SK-SLIC</b> <a href="https://scikit-image.org/">scikit-image</a> module's standard SLIC. Presented as an optimized version of the original SLIC white paper.<br />
<b>JM-SNIC-8</b> My python implementation of SNIC. Purely sequential operation. Non-optimized.<br />
<b>JM-SNIC-4</b> same as above, but with 4-connected neighbors instead of 8.</p>

<p>Runtimes and memory usage with 150 super-pixel segments:</p>
<p align="center">

</p>

<p>As we can see from the chart, of course the optimized and parallelized versions are much faster and efficient. However, comparing JM-SLIC to JM-SNIC, we can see the reduced memory and runtime advantages of SNIC over SLIC when not accounting for parallelism.  When using 4-connected neighbors instead of 8, my SNIC implementation even beats the memory usage of optimized SLIC.</p>

<p>We must keep in mind that SNIC is a sequential algorithm by nature due to the use of the priority queue, and therefore cannot be parallelized nearly as much as SLIC, which can do cluster calculations concurrently or at least vectorized. 
Therefore, if reduced memory usage and complexity are goals, SNIC is a good choice. However, if you have the resources available to use, SLIC may end up a better choice for speed.</p>

<p>Image output comparisons are below. We see that SNIC as implemented outputs comparable super pixels to the original SLIC. We also see that 4-connected SNIC outputs similar results to 8-connected, so we choose 4-connected as our default SNIC method as it is much faster and more memory efficient.</p>
